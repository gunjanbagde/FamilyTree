Limitations / TO DOs -

    This code is optimised for positive test case and might not handle negative test cases entirely.

    If a person has 2 wives and children of first wife will be considered as children of second wife as well eventhough they might not be biological children and vise versa.

    Can not inherit children from wife to husband if the relationship husband is estabilished later.

    Father prompt can connect son automatically, To connect daughter to a father use prompt p1 as daughter of p2 instead of p2 as father of p1 as gender is not handled explicitely.

    Can have a person added to a family tree which is not connected to anyone untill you connect it to anyone.

    Can handle 1 family tree
